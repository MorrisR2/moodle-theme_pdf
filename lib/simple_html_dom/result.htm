If your server was one of the 9,000 servers affected by the fire at The Planet, how              would that affect your company? Would your onsite backup have melted in the same fire?             If your site was hosted at the Core IP datacenter when the FBI shut down the entire              datacenter in a raid over a pirated copy of the Wolverine movie, how would your              customers be affected? If you site was hacked, or someone made a mistake and deleted              an important database? Do you have a <em>tested, working </em>backup, and how many days would             it take to get new servers up and running and restore everything from magnetic tape?          </p>          <p>             Clonebox protects your business from hackers, mistakes, fire, flood, and all other risks.             Clonebox keeps four extra copies of your complete server, in our datacenter, ready to serve your customers at any time.         </p>             <form action="https://www.bettercgi.com/cgi-bin/clonebox/clonebox_order.cgi" class="buttonwrap">                 <input class="calltoaction" type="submit" value="Get protected now">             </form>     </section>      <section>         <h2>How Clonebox works</h2>          <p>             Clonebox maintains four extra copies of your complete server and can take over for your main server at any time.             If your site goes offline for any reason, the DNS entries can simply be switched over to serve your customers              from the copy Clonebox made that morning. If files are inadvertently changed or a hacker damages something and              the problem isn't caught immeditately, Clonebox can launch or restore the copy from the prior day,              the prior week, or the prior month.         </p>          <form action="https://www.bettercgi.com/cgi-bin/clonebox/clonebox_order.cgi" class="buttonwrap">             <input class="calltoaction" type="submit" value="Protect my business now">         </form>      </section>      <section>         <table class="tblexample">             <caption>                 <h2>Annual datacenter failures</h2>             </caption>              <tr>                 <th>Year</th>                 <th>Company</th>                 <th>City</th>                 <th>Servers Affected</th>                 <th>Cause</th>             </tr>              <tr>                 <td>2014</td>                 <td>Bluehost &amp; Hostgator</td>                 <td>Provo, Ut</td>                 <td>250,000</td>                 <td>Router failure</td>             </tr>               <tr>                 <td>2013</td>                 <td>Dreamhost</td>                 <td>Irvine, Ca</td>                 <td>350,000</td>                 <td>Power failure</td>             </tr>              <tr>                 <td>2012</td>                 <td>Godaddy</td>                 <td>Scottsdale, Az</td>                 <td>Millions</td>                 <td>DNS routing tables</td>             </tr>              <tr>                 <td>2011</td>                 <td>Amazon AWS</td>                 <td>Ashburn, Va</td>                 <td>?00,000</td>                 <td>Human error during upgrade</td>             </tr>              <tr>                 <td>2010</td>                 <td>Acronoc</td>                 <td>Houston, Tx</td>                 <td>HVAC failure , insolvency</td>                 <td>1,000</td>             </tr>              <tr>                 <td>2009</td>                 <td>Core IP</td>                 <td>Dallas, Tx</td>                 <td>?</td>                 <td>FBI search warrant</td>             </tr>              <tr>                 <td>2008</td>                 <td>The Planet / Rackshack</td>                 <td>Houston, Tx</td>                 <td>9,000</td>                 <td>Fire</td>             </tr>         </table>     </section>      <footer class="footer" id="footer">         <ul class="nav">             <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>             <li><a href="faq.html">FAQ</a></li>             <li><a href="pricing.html">Pricing</a></li>             <li><a href="miscpricing.html">Misc.
